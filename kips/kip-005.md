# KIP 005 - Raise kUSD Debt Ceiling

Author: Chas Smith, Community Member

### Summary

Raise the debt ceiling to 8,000,000

### Motivation

This increase will allow more kUSD to be minted. It is near the limit at the moment.

### Details

This proposal seeks to update the debt ceiling limit from 4,000,000 kUSD to 8,000,000 kUSD.

With the increase in price of XTZ and new farms etc on the chain, there is more collateral and there are more reasons to borrow.
Because of this, the debt ceiling is near its limit and needs to be increased.
