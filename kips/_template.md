*Note:* Not all proposals are always complete and may be the place for discussion. In that case, you can use the following to notate a point of discussion:

```
🗒️ ⬜ <!-- ✅ --> TODO(your_github_name): Discuss with community \<thing to discuss\>
```

Which renders as:

> 🗒️ ⬜ <!-- ✅ --> **TODO(your_github_name): Discuss with community \<thing to discuss\>**

When resolved, you can either remove the line, or keep it for historical purposes by ammending to:
```
🗒️ ✅ Discussed with community \<thing to discuss\>. See comments in [pull request](https://github.com/hover-labs/kolibri-improvement-proposals/pulls/<PR #>)
```
